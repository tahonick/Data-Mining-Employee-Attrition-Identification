# Employee Attrition Identification via Data Mining

Gallup states that attrition costs US companies at least one trillion dollars annually! We studied the publicly available IBM HR dataset, available via Kaggle to apply a variety of data mining methods to identify groups of employees most likely to leave the fictitious company.

Our objectives for this project:

 - Study data for employees who both leave and stay to gain a better understanding of factors that contribute to attrition
 - Attempt to develop a reasonable strategy for companies to minimize attrition

Some questions we looked to answer included:
 - Which company-controlled factors determine who is most likely to leave the company (also known as churners)?
 - Does job satisfaction determine attrition or job performance?
 - Which features make employees the happiest?
 - Can we accurately predict which employees are likely to leave?
